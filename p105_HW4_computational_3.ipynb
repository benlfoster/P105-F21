    "The set of square-integrable functions ($\\int |f(x)|^2dx<\\infty$) on the interval $[0,\\lambda]$ make up a _Hilbert space_, which is a vector space with an inner product that satisfies certain properties. In this case the space is known as $L^2([0,\\lambda])$, with inner product $\\langle f,g\\rangle = \\int_0^\\lambda f(x)g(x)\\:dx$.\n",

    "With $k_n=n\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$, the functions $c_n = \\cos(k_nx)$ and $s_n =\\sin(k_nx)$ form a __complete and orthogonal basis__ of this Hilbert space, known as the _Fourier basis_. Orthogonality means \\begin{align} \\langle c_m,c_n\\rangle &=C_n\\delta_{m,n},\\\\\\langle s_m,s_n\\rangle &=S_n\\delta_{m,n},\\\\\\langle c_n,s_m\\rangle &= 0,\\end{align} and completeness means $$\\forall f\\in L^2([0,\\lambda]),\\quad f = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{\\langle f,c_n\\rangle}{C_n} c_n+\\frac{\\langle f,s_n\\rangle}{S_n} s_n\\right).$$ This means that any square-integrable function $f(x)$ on a finite domain can be written as a sum of sines and cosines, $$f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\big(A_n\\cos(k_nx)+B_n\\sin(k_nx)\\big).$$ Furthermore, we are guaranteed that at all points $x$ where $f$ is continuous, the above sum converges (so the terms $A_n\\cos(k_nx)+B_n\\sin(k_nx)$ decrease sufficiently quickly).\n",
